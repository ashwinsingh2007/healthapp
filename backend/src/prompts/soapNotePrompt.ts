You will receive a transcript of a conversation between a doctor and a patient.

Your task is to return a STRICT JSON object, exactly in this format:

{
  "Chief Complaint": {
    "soapNote": "string",
    "transcriptionMapping": "string"
  },
  ...
}

- Do NOT return markdown or explanation.
- If you do not have an answer for a field, return "N/A" for both soapNote and transcriptionMapping.
- If the conversation is NOT meaningful or lacks medical context, return all fields with:
  {
    "soapNote": "N/A",
    "transcriptionMapping": "N/A"
  }

Here is a sample transcript:
${exampleTranscript}

Here is the correct JSON output for that sample:
${exampleOutput}

Now here is the transcript to analyze:
"${transcript}"
